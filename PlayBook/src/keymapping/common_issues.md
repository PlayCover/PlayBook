# Common Issues

## Unresponsive Keymapping

>__Note__: Most keymapping issues will fix themselves when you update to macOS Ventura 13.1. You can ignore the following information if you have the update installed already. If you are still having issues after updating, you can create a support post on the [_PlayCover Discord_](https://discord.gg/rMv5qxGTGC) to get help.

Occasionally, keymaps may become unresponsive. This may occur if you use `command ⌘` + `tab` to quickly switch between apps before unlocking your mouse. If this happens there are a couple of steps you can try.

1. Press `option ⌥` to release the mouse, and then press `option ⌥` again to enable keymapping. You may have to do this a couple times to regain control.
2. Use `command ⌘` + `K` to open the Keymapping Editor, and press `command ⌘` + `K` again to close it.
3. If the above doesn't work, restart the app.
4. If the issue persists after restarting the app, save any work you have open and restart your Mac. 

## Incorrect Screen Orientation 

Some apps may rotate the display area incorrectly when you click on certain in-game buttons. Normally on a phone, these buttons require you to hold it in portrait orientation instead of landscape.

For example: clicking on the **View** button in the Valkyrie menu in Honkai Impact 3rd.

When this happens, you can try these steps to fix it without having to restart the app.

1. Press `command ⌘` + `R` to rotate the window, you can also do this by clicking on `Menu bar` > `Keymapping` > `Rotate display area`.
2. If doing the above does not work for the first time, keep pressing `command ⌘` + `R` until the app returns to its correct orientation.
3. If the issue still remain after these steps, restart the app.

>__Note__: This feature is only meant to fix rotation issues while the app is running. The rotation you selected will not be saved when you close the app.
