# Using & Making Keymaps

Many apps and games already have full keymaps available on our [Keymaps repository](https://github.com/PlayCover/keymaps). Additionally, you can find them on the [PlayCover Discord](https://discord.gg/rMv5qxGTGC) `#keymapping` channel. 

>__Note__:If you want to add or share keymaps, see [Importing & Exporting Keymaps](./import_export_keymaps.md) for more information.

## Using Keymapping

Once you've finished importing or creating your keymap, you can toggle it on or off by pressing the `option ⌥` key. Turning on keymapping will hide your cursor but you can still switch between other apps you have open using trackpad gestures or keyboard shortcuts. 

## Creating & Editing Keymaps

You can **open** and **close** the Keymapping Editor while in app using `command ⌘` + `K` or selecting it from the Menu Bar.

After opening the Keymapping Editor you can add a new button by clicking anywhere on the screen. A ring menu will appear around your cursor with different button types. You can click on them to add the type of input you want (see the tables below details and usage). 

Closing the Keymapping Editor will automatically **save** any changes you have made to the keymap.

#### Keymapping Editor button types 

| Symbol | Button | Description |
| :-----------: | :-----------: | ------------- |
| <img width="38" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 2 39 18 PM copy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78054566/210868935-5f04fbbd-48a8-4b99-ba1f-b40c541fad95.png">  | Circle | Adds a single key binding. Useful for pressing buttons on the UI. By default this will create a single button mapped to `LMB` (Left Mouse Button). |
| <img width="38" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 2 39 18 PM copy 2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78054566/210870935-25a6b669-97f2-493e-b607-40304d7fa027.png"> | Directional Pad | Adds an 8-way directional joystick, where Up, Down, Left, and Right are bound to keys (by default mapped to `W` `A` `S` `D`). Useful for movement joysticks. |
| <img width="38" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 2 39 18 PM copy 3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78054566/210871542-588e2aba-a2c3-4a60-ba17-59803c56cb4f.png"> | Directional Arrows | Adds an area for mouse input. Useful for camera control. Can be mapped to other keys to recreate draggable touchscreen aiming controls present in some games. |
| <img width="38" alt="Screenshot 2023-01-05 at 2 39 18 PM copy 4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78054566/210871677-84e9c784-6391-4e7b-951e-81ff1bd9a0a0.png"> | Mouse | Adds a single button bound to mouse control similar to Directional Arrows. Useful for games that require 360-degree movement control instead of 8-way directional movement. |

> __Note__: On legacy versions (prior to 2.0.0 or PlayTools 2.0.1) of PlayCover, there may be RB and LB button types for adding left and right mouse button input.
