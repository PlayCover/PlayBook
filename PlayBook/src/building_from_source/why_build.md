# Why building from source?
Building from source is very confusing for people with little to no knowledge about making apps, therefore, is not recommended for those people. If you just want access to new features before they come out on a stable version, you can check out nightly builds [here](https://github.com/PlayCover/PlayCover/actions/workflows/2.nightly_release.yml?query=is%3Asuccess++).

However, if you want to contribute code to PlayCover, continue on to [Install Prerequisites](./install_prerequisites.md).
