# Why Build from Source?

Building from source is largely intended for developers who wish to make contributions to PlayCover, and is not recommend for those without prior experience making apps. 

If you want access to features before they are released, you can check out nightly builds [here](https://nightly.link/PlayCover/PlayCover/workflows/2.nightly_release/develop).

If you want to contribute code to PlayCover, continue on to [Install Prerequisites](./install_prerequisites.md).
