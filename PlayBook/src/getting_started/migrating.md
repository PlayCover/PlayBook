# Migrating

This page contains instructions on how to migrate from an older version of PlayCover to version 2.0 or later. You can check your current version from the menu bar by clicking `PlayCover` -> `About PlayCover`

## Versions 1.0.6 to 1.1.1 (Community build)
If you were using one of these versions, you don't need to reinstall your apps and most of your settings/keymapping will be converted. However, some settings could still require a few modifications. Here are a few things that you might want to change. 

You can open your settings by selecting on an app and clicking on the gear button on top. You can also get to this screen by right clicking on an app and clicking `Settings`. 

### Changing your performance settings
If you change your tab to `Graphics` in your app settings, you should see a few options. It is recommended to use `iPad Pro M1` as the iOS device for the best graphics, but if your Mac can't handle it and keymapping stutters, you can use one of the iPhones or a weaker iPad instead. 

### Changing your resolution settings
You may need to change your resolution depending on what app you are using. Auto works fine for most games and other apps usually use App Default or Custom. If you are using a set resolution such as 1080p, you might need to change the aspect ratio depending on your monitor. 

## Versions 1.0.5 and earlier (Or non-community build)
If you were using one of these versions, you need to reinstall your apps. It is **HIGHLY SUGGESTED** to **NOT** transfer your apps from the old version, as you may run into numerous issues. You can delete the old folder if you want to free up storage at this location: `~/Library/Containers/me.playcover.PlayCover`. You should also perform the steps for 1.0.6 to 1.1.1, as that setup might be useful for you too.
