#### Decrypt Yourself

You can decrypt your own `.ipa` files including of paid apps you've already bought using a Jailbroken iOS device. There are many guides online on how to do this.

If you run into issues, verify that `Xcode Command Line Tools` are installed, see [Download & Install PlayCover](./download_playcover.md#installing) for more info.

Some apps that contain logins like Genshin Impact will require additional steps to work. You can find the instructions in [Troubleshoot App Login Issues](./troubleshoot_login.md).

> **Note**: Not all apps are supported. If you run into issues not covered in this documentation you can ask for help on the [_PlayCover Discord Server_](https://discord.gg/RNCHsQHr3S).

## Updating

To update an app, you can add it to the **App Library** the same way as you first installed it, either by clicking the 'Add app' button to select the `.ipa` file in Finder, or drag and drop it into PlayCover. The new version of the app will replace the old one while keeping all your logins and data.
