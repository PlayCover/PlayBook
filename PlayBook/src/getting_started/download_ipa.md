# Download & Install iOS .ipa files

.ipa files must be decrypted to install them with PlayCover. Quite often, the app you're looking for will already be decrypted.

## Downloading

There are many sources online for decrypted .ipa files. Listed below are some recommended ones as they can vary in quality, speed, and recentness.

### Suggested Sources:

1. External Websites

    > __NOTE:__ These are external sites, we cannot verify the quality or safety of these downloads. Use at your own risk.

2. Decrypt Yourself

    You can decrypt your own .ipa files including of paid apps you've already bought using a Jailbroken iOS device. There are many guides on how to do this online.

    > __NOTE:__ This will require some technical knowledge, will likely invalidate your warranty, and may permanently damage your device.

## Installing

Installing decrypted .ipa files is simple. Either drag and drop the .ipa file into the PlayCover window, or use the 'Add app' button to select the .ipa file in Finder.

If you run into issues installing, check that `Xcode Command Line Tools` are installed, see [this article](./download_playcover.md#installing) for more info.

Some apps like Genshin Impact will require further and more technical setup to get working. You can find those instructions [here](./troubleshoot_login.md).
